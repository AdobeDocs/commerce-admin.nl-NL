# Assign a company administrator

The company administrator is initially assigned when the company account is first created, and can be modified only by a store administrator from the Admin.

- Each company can have only one assigned administrator.
- A company user can be the administrator for only one company.
- Changes to the assigned company administrator must be completed by a store administrator from the Admin.
